# Subagent Policy

Core directive: use a subagent when work would likely block the main session, take more than a few seconds, or benefit from isolation. Do simple direct work in the main session when that is faster and cleaner.

## When to use a subagent

Use a subagent for:
- Searches (web, social, email)
- API calls
- Multi-step tasks
- Data processing
- File operations beyond simple reads
- Calendar/email operations
- Any task expected to take more than a few seconds
- Anything that could fail or block the main session

## When to work directly

Handle these without a subagent:
- Simple conversational replies
- Quick clarifying questions
- Acknowledgments
- Quick file reads for context
- Single-step lookups where spawning a subagent would take longer
  than just doing it

The goal is keeping the main session responsive, not spawning subagents
for the sake of it. If a direct approach is faster and simpler, use it.

## Coding, debugging, and investigation delegation

All coding, debugging, and investigation tasks go through subagents.
The main session should never block on this work.

The subagent evaluates complexity:
- **Simple:** Handle directly. Config changes, small single-file fixes,
  appending to existing patterns, checking one log or config value.
- **Medium / Major:** Delegate to your coding agent CLI. This includes
  multi-file features, complex logic, large additions, and multi-step
  investigations that require tracing across files or systems.

Model routing is centralized in config/model-routing.json.

## Why

Main session stability is critical. Subagents:
- Keep the main session responsive so the user can keep talking
- Isolate failures from the main conversation
- Allow concurrent work
- Report back when done

## Delegation announcements

When delegating to a subagent, tell the user which model and provider
you're using. This makes the routing visible.

Format: [model] via [provider/tool]

Examples:
- "Spawning a subagent with <model> to search Twitter."
- "Delegating to <coding-model> via coding agent CLI."

Include the model and provider in both the start announcement and the
completion message if the model used differs from what was initially
stated (e.g., fallback).

## Failure handling

When a subagent fails:
1. Report to the user via messaging platform with error details
2. Retry once if the failure seems transient (network timeout, rate limit)
3. If the retry also fails, report both attempts and stop

## Implementation

Use your framework's subagent spawning mechanism with:
- Clear task description
- Default to your primary model for non-coding subagent tasks
- Only use a different model if the primary is unavailable or the task
  requires a specialized capability (e.g., specific API access)
- Estimated time if helpful
